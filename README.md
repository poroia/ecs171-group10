Due May 26

## Project Setup
0. Create venv and activate
  ```bash
    python -m venv env
  ```
  ```bash
    source env/bin/activate # macos/linux
    .\env\Scripts\activate # windows
  ```
1. Install all dependencies 
  ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
_Note: During the install, you might get an error setting up netifaces. Follow instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64261546/python-cant-install-packages_

2. Run the app
